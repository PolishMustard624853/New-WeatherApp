### Weather Application

## Description

This assignment is to build a simple weather application that anybody can use if they are planning a trip so that they can plan accordingly.

I am aware that it is very basic and I am just hoping to get a letter grade for this assignment as I was instructed that my last one was an incomplete. 
I am unable to fetch the high and low data of the current weather, resulting in the blank °c / °c on the deployed app

## Resources 

My brother helped me build this from scratch
Udemy javascript courses that I have been using to study
